## Features

There is a base list consisting of the 2136 Jōyō kanji generated when a user first registers. Users can add kanji to this list, and delete added kanji. 

Users can click on the kanji on the dashboard to register them as known, and click again to register them as not known. 

The exact number of kanji known is kept track of in the top right corner of the dashboard. 

JSON web tokens are used to secure routes and keep track of the user logged in.
